# jupyter-exploration

In the lab, I set up a GitHub account, created a repository named "jupyter-exploration," and installed Jupyter Notebook through Anaconda. I then created and executed a notebook, saved it, and uploaded it to the GitHub repository, gaining valuable experience in version control and interactive computing.
